= Deploy Account Microservice

[#new-app]
== Create the Account Microservice Application

We'll be using a prebuilt Native Quarkus image available on https://quay.io/rhdevelopers[]:

And since we want to guarantee that every user is publishing and consuming to a different kafka topic, we'll be providing the `mp.messaging.incoming.transactions.topic` environment variable to our application pointing to our custom topic.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-app quay.io/rhdevelopers/eda-tutorial-kafka-account --name=account -e mp.messaging.incoming.transactions.topic=transactions-$WORKSHOP_USER
----

Let's expose the app so we can consume it through `curl`:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc expose svc/account
----

[#query-account]
== List Available Accounts

For memory constraints, we're just using an in-memory repository for the accounts. In real workloads you would use some kind of persistence storage such as a relational database.

Let's query our Account REST resource to list all available accounts and their respective amounts:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -w "\n" $(oc get route/account -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/account
----

This should be an empty JSON list, since we just deployed the microservice and we didn't consume any transactions yet.

Now let's publish some transactions again and see what happens:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -w "\n" -X POST "$(oc get route/transaction -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/transaction" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"account\":1001,\"amount\":33,\"type\":\"CREDIT\"}"
curl -w "\n" -X POST "$(oc get route/transaction -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/transaction" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"account\":1002,\"amount\":25,\"type\":\"CREDIT\"}"
----

If we query the REST resource again, we should be able to see two accounts with their respective amounts:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -w "\n" $(oc get route/account -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/account
----

We can also query the accounts individually by specifying them in our HTTP endpoint:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -w "\n" $(oc get route/account -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/account/1001
curl -w "\n" $(oc get route/account -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/account/1002
----

[#check-logs]
== Check the Account Microservice logs

Let's check the application logs to see what's happening:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc logs $(oc get po -o name -l app=account) -f
----
