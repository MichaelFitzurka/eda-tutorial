[#cli-tools]
== CLI tools

You will be extensively using the Terminal on this workshop, so the following CLI tools are required:

* oc (Openshift client)
** MacOS: `brew install openshift-cli`
** Other: https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Openshift Releases]

* `curl`, `gunzip`, `tar`
** Mac OS: built-in or part of your bash shell
** Fedora: should also be installed already, but just in case... `dnf install curl gzip tar`
** Windows: Make sure you have the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows Subsystem for Linux] installed.

[#environment-setup]

Create an environment variable for your user and log into OpenShift.

oc login -u $WORKSHOP_USER -p <password> <my-cluster-url>

Make sure you're using the right OpenShift project:
