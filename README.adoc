There are 90 available users on this OpenShift installation. Please use the Etherpad to share with the other attendees your chosen user.

Your login will be `userXX`, where XX ranges from 1 to 90.

The password is `openshift`;

Now it's time for you to set your environment, but *remember to replace `userXX` with your real user!*:

[source,bash]
---- 
export WORKSHOP_USER=userXX

oc login https://master.atlanta-890d.openshiftworkshop.com/ -u $WORKSHOP_USER -p openshift
----

== Deploying your application to OpenShift:

First we need to tell OpenShift to create a build definition:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-build --binary --name=myapp
----

Now every time you wish to build your application, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
oc start-build myapp --from-dir=. --follow
----

Once you have at least one successfull build, you can ask OpenShift to run your application:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-build --binary --name=myapp
----

If you wish your application to be publicly exposed, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
oc expose svc/myapp
----
